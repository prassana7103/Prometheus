# Troubleshooting Prometheus Grafana Setup

This guide provides troubleshooting steps for common errors encountered during the setup of Prometheus and Grafana in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Pod Scheduling Errors:

### Data Collection:
One of the primary challenges is ensuring that Prometheus collects metrics from the target systems accurately and consistently, particularly in our Kubernetes (K8s) cluster.

- **Node Exporter Installation:** Initially, only node-level metrics were visible in Prometheus. However, to gather metrics from the entire Kubernetes cluster, kube-state-metrics should be used.

  - *Resolution:* Refer to reliable sources or documentation to correctly install kube-state-metrics in the Kubernetes cluster. Ensure proper configuration to collect metrics from the entire K8s cluster.

- **Error Pulling kube-state-metrics:**
  When attempting to fetch kube-state-metrics, there was an error.

  - *Resolution:* Verify the image being pulled and used. Often, incorrect image references can lead to errors. Find and use the correct image to resolve this issue.

## Pod Failure:

Sometimes, pods were observed to fail or enter a crash loop.

- **Crash Loop Logs Inspection:**
  Upon inspection of logs, it was evident that pods were entering a crash loop.

  - *Resolution:* Check YAML syntax for errors. Correct any syntax mistakes and redeploy the configuration.

- **Image Versioning:**
  There were issues related to improper image usage.

  - *Resolution:* Verify the image references and ensure the correct versions are being used. Using outdated or incorrect versions can lead to unexpected behavior or failures.

## Volume Mount:

After creating a volume mount for the Prometheus configmap, it's crucial to ensure its correctness. Otherwise, Prometheus may fail to obtain the necessary configuration, leading to operational issues.

## Grafana Dashboard:

- **No Data Displayed on Grafana Dashboard:**
  Even after adding a data source, no metrics were visible on the Grafana dashboard.

  - *Resolution:* Review the queries configured in Grafana and ensure they match the available metrics. Adjust queries as needed to align with the metrics being collected, enabling data visualization on the Grafana dashboard.

By following these troubleshooting steps and ensuring attention to detail in configuration and resource references, common issues encountered during the setup of Prometheus and Grafana in a Kubernetes environment can be effectively resolved.
